### The Project Description

## Pantry Tracker

"Everyone deserves food security"

The idea: A platform for food banks and community pantries to manage their operations and connect with their community. The core idea: make it easier for pantries to track what they have, and for people who need food to know what's available before making the trip.

Think about the different people who might use this: pantry staff managing inventory, volunteers signing up for shifts, and community members checking availability. How can you make each of their experiences smooth and dignified?

## MVP

Use Cases (for a food seeker)

1. I am a food seeker and I am looking for a specific food item. (in a nearby locale - within certain # km -> maybe this become more flexible to use other units later)
2. I am a food seeker and I am just looking for a food bank nearby.
3. I am a food seeker and I need to lookup opening hours for my food bank (search by name)-> hours should appear in a localized way
4. I am a food seeker and I need to find food by category (eg. baby food )

Use Cases (for a a food bank/pantry)

1. I am food bank, and I register for using this app... (I give you my name, location, hours, website, contact info, some way to allow staff to register too)
2. I am a food bank, and I want to login (as the staff, so securely)
3. I am a food bank, I want to add/delete/update food items (name, description, min-amount, category, barcode)
4. I am a food bank, and I want to add/subtract food quantity/inventory
5. I am a food bank and I can create or delete a box (what it contains in terms of food)
6. I am a food bank and I want to add/subtract a box
7. I am a food bank and I need to create food categories (delete/update them

### Nice to have features

1. I am a food bank and I can state that I am looking for volunteers (maybe that entails hours/rules/applications/references)
2. I am a volunteer and I am looking to volunteer somewhere (??? figure it out later)
